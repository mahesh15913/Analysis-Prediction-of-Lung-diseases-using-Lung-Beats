                        <p>&#128973 This step involves importing the text files from the dataset which having the details of the respiratory cycles, sound feature of the lung disease, and patient demographic information.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>&#128973 The information are extracted from the file and converted into data frame. This data frame contains audio classification and patient demographic information. </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>&#128973 The audio files should be imported with “.wav” extension and split the large audio into multiple smaller audio files based on the respiratory cycle. The names for the audio files should be annotated and create a directory for the files.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>&#128973 This step involves Creating a new data frame table with a divided audio files and patient disease data. The data is split into train and test data for CNN model</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>&#128973 Now extract features from the feature extractions such as mfcc (Mel–frequency cepstral coefficients), cstft (Chroma Short-Time Fourier Transform), mspec(Mel spectrogram) using librosa package. And apply the padding to the features to convert Numpy arrays to single numpy array. </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>&#128973 Three CNN models are built for three feature extraction techniques and after the three CNN models are concatenated, we will feed the features to dense layer of neural network. </p>

                        In conclusion, the lung disease prediction model developed in this project help us gain significant advancement in medical diagnostics by using deep learning and machine learning. By curating a comprehensive dataset of live audios of respiratory depicting various lung diseases and put through rigorous preprocessing, using various feature extracting techniques like MFCC, CSTFT and MSPEC. Utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), we successfully extracted relevant features from the audios which help us to accurately predict different diseases in initial phase of illness.
