                    Lung disease is a broad term that encapsulates any condition that hinders the optimal functioning of the lungs. It is typically classified into three main categories: Airway diseases, Lung tissue diseases, and Lung Circulation diseases. Each category represents a unique set of challenges, as they affect different aspects of lung function and present distinct symptoms and treatment approaches.

                <p>
                    The primary objective of this project is to harness the potential of respiratory sound analysis as a tool for predicting lung health. By scrutinizing these sounds, we aim to ascertain the condition of the lungs, distinguishing between healthy and diseased states. This novel methodology could potentially transform the way we diagnose and monitor lung diseases.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Our goal is to conduct extensive research to identify the most accurate deep learning algorithm for the analysis and prediction of lung diseases. We believe that respiratory sounds are key to detecting lung diseases, and implementing this using deep learning could unlock new possibilities in healthcare.

                            In conclusion, the lung disease prediction model developed in this project help us gain significant advancement in medical diagnostics by using deep learning and machine learning. By curating a comprehensive dataset of live audios of respiratory depicting various lung diseases and put through rigorous preprocessing, using various feature extracting techniques like MFCC, CSTFT and MSPEC. Utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), we successfully extracted relevant features from the audios which help us to accurately predict different diseases in initial phase of illness.
